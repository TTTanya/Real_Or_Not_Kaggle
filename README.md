# Real_Or_Not_Kaggle

In this competition, I'm challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. I have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. 

In this project I'm using NLP with neural networks testing three different architectures: CNN, LSTM and GRU.
