# Real_Or_Not_Kaggle

In this competition, I'm challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. I have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. 

In this project I'm using NLP with neural networks testing three different architectures: CNN, LSTM and GRU.  

Best score evaluated in metric 'Accuracy' = 0.81.

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
